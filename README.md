## こんにちは！

This is a customised fork of https://github.com/jensechu/kanji. It's a small javascript powered site that takes in `.json` data of kanji and immediately renders those kanji on the page for printing kanji practice worksheets. The page title is also customisable, defined in the json data file.

This application is used by ![Westside Japanese Lessons](http://www.westsidejapanese.com.au) for printing Kanji worksheets for our students.

The main deviations from the original version are:
* The removal of categories
* The addition of an import function
* Adding our branding

A big thank you to Jensen for putting together the original from which this was derived.

### Formatted Sheet When Printed:
This is a shot of a formatted worksheet when you attempt to print from the website! You can select as many kanji as you want and it will always look shiny.
